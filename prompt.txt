**Current Status Update:**

✅ **VoiceSynthesisService Complete** - Service built with test mode, running successfully
✅ **Mock Testing Ready** - 4 test scenarios: success, failure_quota, failure_synthesis, failure_storage

**Issue**: I was trying to find the best place to integrate the voice synthesis into the existing AIOrchestrator node but got stuck searching through the codebase instead of making a clear decision.

**Options for Voice Integration:**

1. **Modify AIOrchestrator Node**: Add voice synthesis as a new operation to the existing node
2. **Create New Voice Node**: Separate n8n node specifically for voice synthesis 
3. **Extend generateResponse**: Add voice output to the existing generateResponse operation

**Context Needed:**
- The current AIOrchestrator has operations like `routeAIRequest`, `generateResponse`, `analyzeModelPerformance`, etc.
- We need to implement the workflow: Trigger → Respond → HTTP Request → Wait → IF → WhatsApp
- The service is ready to receive calls at `/synthesize` endpoint

**Request**: Stop the analysis paralysis. Give me a direct recommendation on the cleanest integration approach and the exact steps to implement it. Should I:

A) Add a new `synthesizeVoice` operation to AIOrchestrator?
B) Create a standalone VoiceSynthesis node?
C) Modify the existing `generateResponse` to include voice output routing?

I need to move forward with implementation immediately.
