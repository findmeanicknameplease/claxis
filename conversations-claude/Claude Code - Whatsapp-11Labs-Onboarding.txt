What do you mean by two numbers - 20 numbers?

Edit

Decoded WhatsApp Business API phone number verification limits.
5s






Great question! Let me clarify this important WhatsApp Business API limitation that could significantly impact your business model.

üì± WhatsApp Phone Number Limits Explained
"Phone Numbers" = Different WhatsApp Business Lines
This refers to how many different WhatsApp Business phone numbers you can manage under one Facebook Business Manager account.

Without Business Verification:
Maximum 2 phone numbers per Facebook Business Manager account
Each number can handle 250 business-initiated conversations/day
Total capacity: 500 conversations/day across 2 numbers 
WhatsApp Business API Is Facebook Business Manager ...
With Business Verification + Tier 1 Status:
Maximum 20 phone numbers per Facebook Business Manager account
Each number can handle 1,000+ business-initiated conversations/day
Total capacity: 20,000+ conversations/day across 20 numbers 
WhatsApp Business API Is Facebook Business Manager ...
üè¢ Why This Matters for Your Business Model
Scenario 1: Single Salon
typescript
const singleSalonSetup = {
  phone_numbers_needed: 1,
  limitation: "No problem - each salon needs only 1 number",
  capacity: "250 conversations/day = 7,500/month",
  reality_check: "Most salons do 50-200 bookings/month"
};
Scenario 2: Multi-Location Salon Chain
typescript
const salonChainSetup = {
  locations: 5,
  phone_numbers_needed: 5, // One per location
  without_verification: {
    max_locations: 2, // Can only manage 2 locations
    limitation: "MAJOR PROBLEM for chains"
  },
  with_verification: {
    max_locations: 20, // Can manage up to 20 locations
    perfect_for: "Salon chains and franchises"
  }
};
Scenario 3: SaaS Platform (Your Situation)
typescript
const saasProviderImpact = {
  business_model: "Each salon needs their own phone number",
  
  without_verification: {
    max_salons_per_business_manager: 2,
    workaround: "Create multiple Facebook Business Manager accounts",
    complexity: "Very high operational overhead"
  },
  
  with_verification: {
    max_salons_per_business_manager: 20,
    scaling_strategy: "Create new Business Manager every 20 salons",
    operational_complexity: "Manageable"
  }
};
üéØ Strategic Implications for Your Platform
Option 1: Shared Number Model (Not Recommended)
typescript
const sharedNumberModel = {
  concept: "All salons share the same WhatsApp number",
  problems: [
    "Customers confused about which salon they're messaging",
    "No brand identity for individual salons", 
    "Legal/compliance issues with shared identity",
    "Poor customer experience"
  ],
  verdict: "‚ùå Not viable for professional salon automation"
};
Option 2: Dedicated Number Model (Recommended)
typescript
const dedicatedNumberModel = {
  concept: "Each salon gets their own WhatsApp Business number",
  benefits: [
    "‚úÖ Professional brand identity per salon",
    "‚úÖ Direct customer-salon relationship", 
    "‚úÖ Better customer experience",
    "‚úÖ Easier compliance and management"
  ],
  
  scaling_challenges: {
    without_verification: "Limited to 2 salons per Business Manager",
    with_verification: "Can handle 20 salons per Business Manager",
    enterprise_solution: "Multiple Business Managers for 100+ salons"
  }
};

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
üí° Key Takeaway
The 2 vs 20 phone numbers limitation is actually a business opportunity:

Free/Basic Tier: Help salons with existing WhatsApp Business (no extra numbers needed)
Professional Tier: Assist with getting dedicated business numbers
Enterprise Tier: Include business verification to unlock 20x capacity + premium features
This limitation creates a natural upgrade path and justifies your premium pricing tiers!
